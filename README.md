# CPSC 210 FINAL PROJECT - TYPING MASTER

## What will the application do?
For my CPSC 210 project, I will be creating a **typing practice application** that measures the user's *typing speed and accuracy*. For every 2% loss in accuracy, the user will need to solve a problem in order to save their progress. They will have the option to choose between *math, logic, trivia, or a 50/50 coin toss* (where they have to guess the correct side to pass) after they complete their typing test. For every 10% loss in accuracy, the user will receive an extra-challenging problem. This additonal feature promotes the user to improve their accuracy. The user will be able to track their previous typing test records and improvements in both typing speed and accuracy. 

## Who will use it?
Anyone who wants to improve their typing speed and accuracy is welcome and encouraged to use this application! 
The target audience is users who type frequently, including but not limited to:
- Students (especially in computer science)
- Typists
- Writers

## Why is this project of interest to you?
There are many online typing practices like [monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/), [typeracer](https://play.typeracer.com/), and [Typing.com Games](https://www.typing.com/student/games). My go-to is monkeytype for its simple graphics, but I love the interactive game aspect of the latter sites. So, I would like to mix these two for a simple typing practice with a clean design that initially focuses solely on typing, then encourages the user to improve with the accuracy discipline system. 


## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to view my typing speed and accuracy 
- As a user, I want to be able to select which area I want to focus on 
            (regular, short phrases, punctuation-focused, number-focused)
- As a user, I want to be able to add my current typing run to my record of typing results, and any upcoming runs 
- As a user, I want to be able to view a list of previous typing results 
            with their respective typing speed and accuracy, and the overall typing speed and accuracy
