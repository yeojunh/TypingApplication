# CPSC 210 FINAL PROJECT - TYPING MASTER

## What will the application do?
For my CPSC 210 project, I will be creating a **typing practice application** that measures the user's *typing speed and accuracy*. 
The user will be able to track their previous typing test records for typing speed and accuracy.
The typing speed will be calculated in words per minute (wpm), and accuracy will be based on the percentage of words typed correctly. 

## Who will use it?
Anyone who wants to improve their typing speed and accuracy is welcome and encouraged to use this application! 
The target audience is users who type frequently, including but not limited to:
- Students (especially in computer science)
- Typists
- Writers

## Why is this project of interest to you?
There are many online typing practices like [monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/), [typeracer](https://play.typeracer.com/), and [Typing.com Games](https://www.typing.com/student/games). My go-to is monkeytype for its simple graphics, but I love the interactive game aspect of the latter sites. So, I would like to mix these two for a simple typing practice with a clean design that initially focuses solely on typing, then encourages the user to improve with the accuracy discipline system.
